        <p>Gogowise was  first set up on 30th January 2011 by Dr. Zeng Zeng. Together with his development team, the Gogowise website and core system structures were setup by mid of September 2011. In the later part of the year, the founding team of Gogowise decided to focus the company on online education, catering to the needs of education institutions and zooming in to their students. At the same time, the development of the system was almost complete, the very first version of the website was launched, and the construction of the platform features were delegated to the development team leaders.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter of 2012, Gogowise’s first UI/UX designers joined the team. The company made great progress in developing its core features (e.g. Lesson Management System, Organization Management System, etc).</p>
        <p>Gogowise is extremely grateful to the National University of Singapore (NUS) for participating in our pilot system testing in May 2012. The first course conducted on Gogowise was NUS Gogowise English Online, a 10-lesson course over 5 weeks in a 1-to-2 setting. After which, an NUS tutor Sahil conducted a VIP customized 1-to-1 English course for Huang Yao from Beijing. </p>
        <p>The year of 2013 saw the company’s official incorporation in Singapore- Gogowise Cloud Education Pte Ltd. We were also awarded MDA’s iJAM grant and a 26-organization-strong consortium for our application for IDA’s Call-For-Collaboration (CFC) Programme. On the development front, the beta version of Gogowise is well on its way, together with the launch of pilot courses for our valued clients.</p>
